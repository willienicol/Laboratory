Our current estimate is that 2.22$m^3$ of biogas has the equivalent heating capacity of 1 kg LPG. This implies that we will require 0.74$m^3$ of biogas daily for our family of 5. \n",

    "But how much food and other organic waste is required to generate this amount of gas? It all relates to the volatile solids (VS) in the organic waste. Results on municipal organic waste suggest that an average of 20% of the wet organic waste consists out of VS. Typical values of biogas generated from VS in organic waste suggest that 0.3-0.7 $m^3$ of biogas can be generated from 1kg of VS. We will use 0.4 $\\frac{m^3}{kg \\, VS}$ as conservative estimate. This implies that our household will require 1.85kg of volitale solids or 9.25 kg of wet organic waste per day to keep the food cooked. Perhaps the estimate of 20% VS in organic waste is a bit high? We will determine this number form our own feed that we will make up.   \n"

The VS will be 0.09$\\frac{kg TS}{kg \\, slurry}$ and the rest of the slurry will be water of 0.9 $\\frac{kg water}{kg \\, slurry}$ of which 0.36 $\\frac{kg water}{kg \\, slurry}$ will be contained in the organic waste. Make sure you agree with these numbers! \n",

    "The time spent in the ferementer is the slurry volume devided by the slurry flowrate called the hydaulic retention time (HRT). If we use a HRT of 40 days as a baseline, the slurry volume will be 0.82$m^3$. The rule of thumb is that the volume of biogas production daily should be the same as the liquid volume in digester.
