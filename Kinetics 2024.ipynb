    "You will be supplied with 3 liters each of 0.08 mol/L ethyl acetate (A mixture) and 0.04 mol/L of NaOH. In addition, you will get 2 liters of 0.16 mol/L ethyl acetate (B mixture).\n",

    "The experiment will start with the beaker filled with distilled water (almost zero electrical conductivity). For the first 40 minutes, you will use the NaOH mixture and the A mixture of ethyl acetate. From 40 to 80 minutes the A mixture of ethyl acetate will be replaced by the B mixture of ethyl acetate. After 80 minutes you will revert to using the A mixture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that both reagent flows get mixed into the CSTR the inlet concentration to the CSTR will be 0.02 mol/L of NaOH (reagent A) and 0.04 mol/l of ethyl acetate (reagent B). Similarly, the B-mixture will be diluted to 0.08 mol/L for the 40 to 80-minute time interval. The EC (electrical conductivity) measurements in the reactor will be recorded at regular time intervals as time progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both NaOH (A) and sodium acetate (C) contribute to EC. The conductivity of A is more than the conductivity of C and accordingly, EC will drop as conversion takes place. EC can be presented by:\n",
