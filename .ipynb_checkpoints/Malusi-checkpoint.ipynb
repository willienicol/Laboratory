Typical values of biogas generated from VS in organic waste suggest that 0.3-0.7 $m^3$ of biogas can be generated from 1kg of VS. We will use 0.4 $\\frac{m^3}{kg \\, VS}$ as a conservative estimate. This implies that our household will require 1.85kg of volatile solids or 9.25 kg of wet organic waste per day to keep the food cooked. Perhaps the estimate of 20% VS in organic waste is a bit high?
