    "In this experiment it will all be about defining a 'path' from theory and then entering the lab prepared so that that your group can experimentally follow the path that you have set out to follow. Have a look at the following graphs:\n",

    "In this experiment you will be following the the 'correctness' of your theoretical graph reperesented by the black curve above. You will plot your concentration measurements on the same graph as your theoretical prediction and then determine the thickness of the 'tube' that encapsulates all your experimental measurements. The thinner your tube, the more your marks. This entails that you are a 100% sure about your theoretical prediction prior to the experiment and that you perform your experiment with precision in order to make the tube as thin as possible."

    "### What does the experiment entail?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment two liquid phase reagents will be supplied at fixed concentrations. The kinetics of the reaction will be supplied. The peristaltic pump will pump both reagents (seperately) at the same flowrate. You will be able to easily adjust this flowrate as time progress. The reagents will be fed to two CSTRs connected in series. A conductivity probe will be used in each CSTR and from the conductivity reading you will be able to infer the concentrations of the reagents and products and accordingly plot your data within your 'tube'. Your theoretical curve of the reagent concentrations in each CSTR as time progress will have to be submitted prior to the experiment on Discord. Once the experiment of 2.5 hours is done you will have to determine your tube thickness. You then have to prepare an oral presentation to present your results. In this presentation you will have to show your experimental data on the theoretical profiles that you submitted prior to the experiment. You can also provide improved theoretical models after presenting your original model in order to decrease the 'tube' diameter of your fit. All four members need to be ready to present and I will pick and alter presenters as we go through the presentation. Provided that your presentation is deemed sufficient you won't be expected to write an report. If the presentation is deemed insufficient you will be expected to submit a report within a week after the oral presentation. The objective is to have deep insight into the experiment as this will be tested during the the oral feedback session.  "

    "You will be supplied with 3 liters each of 0.08 mol/L ethyl acetate and 0.04 mol/L of NaOH. Ensure that the total accumulative flow of your 2.5 hour experiment is less than 6L. Given that both reagent flows gets mixed into the CSTR the inlet concentration to the first CSTR will be 0.02 mol/L of NaOH (reagent A) and 0.04 mol/l of ethyl acetate (reagent B). At the start of the 2.5 hour run both CSTRs will be filled with distilled water (almost zero electrical conductivity). The EC (electrical conductivity) measurements in each reactor will be recorded on regular time intervals as time progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both NaOH (A) and sodium acetate (C) contributes to EC. The conductivity of A is more than the conductivity of C and accordingly EC will drop as conversion takes place. In order to calculate the conversion of A (and accordingly the concentration of A and B) you need to know the EC value of a 100% conversion of A. This can be obtained by running a batch reactor with an initial concentration of 0.02 mol/L of A and 0.04 mol/l of B. Once the run is completed the EC vlaue will stabilise to $K_{FINAL}$. The conversion of A at any moment in time will be given by the following equation:\n",

    "$$ x=\\frac{K_{START}-K}{K_{START}-K_{FINAL}}$$\n",

    "$$C_A=0.02 \\cdot (1-x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment will be performed at ambient temperature and it is crucial to measure temperature at all times. There is likely to be a slight temperature increase as the experiment progress. EC is unfortunately temperature dependant. Within the temperature ranges that we will be working we'll assume a linear dependancy of EC on temperature. Your TA will assist you with your temperature corrections. Best practise will be to have a 0.02 mol/L solution of NaOH and a completed batch run (described above) readily available to monitor $K_{START}$ and $K_{FINAL}$ as temperature varies during the day.

    "You are expected to change the flowrate at least 3 times after commencing with the experiment. Please note that the flowrate can be set to zero which will imply that both CSTRs will operate as batch reactors. Your $C_A$ value from the second CSTR should exceed 0.017 mol/L once during the run and it should also go lower than 0.003 mol/L during the run. As for the rest of the run you want to avoid extended steady states and rather have major variation in your $C_A$ range (from 0 to 0.02 mol/L). \n",
